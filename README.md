# Ode to My Schnoodle #

This is an early project, one of the first assignments in Free Code Camp. I chose to dedicate a static page to my schnoodle, Felix. This assignment was my first attempt as using a full page background image that scaled responsively. I also learned a lot about trying to make text legible when using a full page background image.
